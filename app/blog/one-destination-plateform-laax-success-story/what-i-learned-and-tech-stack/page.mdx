# What I learned (the stuff you don’t see on the homepage) + Tech stack (the pieces that made it ship)

## What I learned (the stuff you don’t see on the homepage)

### 1) Alignment > code

Cross-department platforms fail more from misalignment than from bugs.
You need shared incentives, clear ownership, and leadership support.

### 2) Content modeling is product design

A good schema prevents chaos.
A bad schema creates infinite edge cases.

### 3) Performance is a feature (especially on maps)

On an interactive map, small delays compound quickly - especially on mobile.

### 4) “Easy” is usually hard work

“Easy, selbsterklärend” (self-explanatory) is not an accident.
It’s hundreds of small UX decisions.
