My biggest exp in web dev. The goal was to build a single destination platform that brings together lifts, hotels, school, and the rest of the resort stakeholders.

Result: **3 new features** | **6k users avg. daily visitors** | **7,454 visitors peak in a day**

# One Destination Plateform: LAAX Success Story

I started working remotely for the project in **August 2024**… from **Amsterdam**.

A few months later, my colleague and me travelled into the mountains for to meet in person the hole team.

My satisfaction: _having real interaction with people instead a video screen_

Just after settle, we were invited in the special meeting room. I didn't expect to have **everyone**: Guest Care (support), Hotels, LAAX School, Tickets/Lifts, Finance… all the people we’d been building for, sometimes debating with, and always trying to align.

That moment made the project real:

**we weren’t shipping “a website”, we were building a shared platform for an entire resort.**

## Launch #1 - Marketing website (Nov 2024)

![Sanity content studio showing LAAX marketing content structure](/laax/sanity.png)

### What we shipped

A new **Next.js** website powered by **Sanity CMS** for:

- LAAX marketing pages
- and **MICE** (LAAX Meetings & Events, the B2B department)

### What I did

- **CMS benchmark** (Prismic vs Strapi vs Payload vs Sanity) → chose **Sanity**
- Built the initial **content structure (schemas)** so marketing could actually run with it
- Copied the old site’s look & feel **with a modern touch** (without breaking the brand)
- **Onboarded the marketing team** (4 people) + supported content migration

### Proof it worked (traffic jump)

In the two periods below (same days duration), active users went from ~20k to ~141k:

- Sep 1 → Nov 3, 2024 (old WordPress): **~318 avg per day**
- Nov 17 → Jan 19, 2025 (new site): **~2,209 avg per day**

That’s a **+594% increase** in active users in just a few months.

## Launch #2 - Unified e-commerce (Jun 2025)

![LAAX e-commerce flow showing products and checkout](/laax/shop.png)

### What “unified e-commerce” means (in real life)

One cart that can include:

- **Accommodations** (via SimpleBooking)
- **Lift tickets** (via WAG)
- **School lessons** (independant system)

### The part I led: LAAX School (customer + admin + emails)

School situation in few lines:

- we need to do copy the current system and improve it
- we need to understand the full offer (winter sports, summer sports, events, childcare)
- we need to understand the full logic of bookings (quota, on request)
- we have to integrate school in the e-commerce customer face and also the **admin tool**
- we need to integrate the **email** that makes the experience feel complete

### Proof it worked (school revenue)

From **May → Aug 2025**, school bookings delivered:

| Metric        |               Performance |
| ------------- | ------------------------: |
| Total Revenue | **↗ 30% compare to 2024** |

The best compliments we've from the responsable of school was just:

> “This week, we hit our highest number of bookings ever.”

## Launch #3 - Map, Webcams and AI Assistant (Nov 2025)

![Interactive LAAX resort map with live lift status and layers](/laax/map.png)

This launch is where the platform moved from “booking” to **real-time resort experience**.

### 1) The interactive resort map (MapLibre)

The old map basically showed just lift status, slopes and webcams.

We shipped a map that still keeps the previous features, but adds bus live tracking, point of interests (restaurants, snowparks, etc.)

### 2) Webcams that are actually usable

Create a new page webcams and use the map to display the location of all webcams (bridge between features).
Handle a premium status for the gatecams.

### 3) AI assistant (with voice)

Instead of a ChatGPT that knows everything, we close the opening informations to only the database we give.
That means if the scope is out of his "brain" (database), he will directly answer that he doen't know and reditrect to the support team.
