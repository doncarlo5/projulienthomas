# From a Website to a Platform: My LAAX Success Story (3 launches, 15 months, real results)

I started working on LAAX in **August 2024**… from **Amsterdam**.

A few months later, we travelled into the mountains for the start of winter season. After **plane → train → bus**, we walked into one of the biggest meeting rooms I’ve ever seen.

And suddenly: _faces instead of Microsoft Teams avatars._

In that room there wasn’t “the client.” There was **everyone**: Guest Care (support), Hotels, LAAX School, Tickets/Lifts, Finance… all the people we’d been building for, sometimes debating with, and always trying to align.

That moment made the project real:

**we weren’t shipping “a website”, we were building a shared platform for an entire resort.**

---

## The hard truth: guests want one journey, but resorts are many businesses

Planning a mountain day online sounds simple… until it’s not:

- tickets in one place
- lessons somewhere else
- hotels somewhere else
- and real-time info (lifts / map / webcams) spread across pages

At LAAX, not every department initially agreed on the idea of **one platform**.

What made the difference was leadership support from the top (Reto **Gurtner**), which helped align stakeholders and push collaboration when things could’ve stayed fragmented.

## The roadmap: 3 launches that built momentum

| Launch | Date         | What shipped                                 | What I owned / contributed                                                                |
| -----: | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|      1 | **Nov 2024** | Marketing / Showcase website (+ MICE)        | CMS study → **Sanity selected**, schemas, onboarding marketing, modernized styling        |
|      2 | **Jun 2025** | Unified e-commerce (hotels, tickets, school) | **LAAX School system** end-to-end (customer + admin + emails)                             |
|      3 | **Nov 2025** | Interactive map + webcams + AI assistant     | Map UX + layers (**MapLibre**), improved webcams UX + premium gating, assistant structure |

## Launch #1 - Marketing website (Nov 2024)

![Sanity content studio showing LAAX marketing content structure](/laax/sanity.png)

### What we shipped

A new **Next.js** website powered by **Sanity CMS** for:

- LAAX marketing pages
- and **MICE** (LAAX Meetings & Events, the B2B department)

### What I did

- **CMS benchmark** (Prismic vs Strapi vs Payload vs Sanity) → chose **Sanity**
- Built the initial **content structure (schemas)** so marketing could actually run with it
- Copied the old site’s look & feel **with a modern touch** (without breaking the brand)
- **Onboarded the marketing team** (4 people) + supported content migration

### Proof it worked (traffic jump)

In the two periods below (same duration), active users went from ~20k to ~141k:

- **Sep 1 → Nov 3, 2024 (old WordPress):** 20,379 users / 64 days → **~318/day**
- **Nov 17 → Jan 19, 2025 (new site):** 141,393 users / 64 days → **~2,209/day**

That’s a **+593.8% increase** in active users in just a few months.

## Launch #2 - Unified e-commerce (Jun 2025)

![LAAX e-commerce flow showing products and checkout](/laax/shop.png)

### What “unified e-commerce” means (in real life)

One cart that can include:

- **Accommodations** (via SimpleBooking)
- **Lift tickets** (via WAG)
- **School lessons** (and events)

### The part I led: LAAX School (customer + admin + emails)

School was the toughest (and most interesting) integration because:

- they already had a working system before
- but once everything moved into one platform, we needed to **recreate the customer booking UX**
- and also build a real **admin tool** to manage:
  - lessons
  - quotas
  - schedules
  - operational edge cases
- plus the **email layer** that makes the experience feel complete

This is where my sales background helped a lot:
**conversion is often just “remove friction + build trust.”**

### Proof it worked (school revenue)

From **May → Aug 2025**, school bookings delivered:

| Metric        |               Performance |
| ------------- | ------------------------: |
| Total Revenue | **↗ 30% compare to 2024** |

And one of the best compliments I got from the school side was simple:

> “We had the best week of bookings we never had before.”

## Launch #3 - Map + Webcams + AI Assistant (Nov 2025)

![Interactive LAAX resort map with live lift status and layers](/laax/map.png)

This launch is where the platform moved from “booking” to **real-time resort experience**.

### 1) The interactive resort map (MapLibre)

The old map basically showed lift status - and that was it.

We shipped a map that still keeps lift status as the core, but adds real utility:

- lift status (main goal)
- slopes
- hiking & sledging routes
- restaurants
- webcams
- accommodations
- ticket offices
- pickup stations
- LAAX School offices
- rentals
- snowparks + Freestyle Academy
- parkings + lockers
- restricted / nature protected areas
- **live bus positions**

### 2) Webcams that are actually usable

We built `/webcams` with:

- better UX/UI (including “big screen” viewing)
- **gatecams** as a premium feature:
  - if you’re not premium → it’s blurred
  - if you are premium → full access  
    → a simple product mechanic that supports the business model

### 3) AI assistant (with voice)

The assistant pulls structured knowledge from:

- the WAG Sanity database
- and our own Sanity database

It can help with questions like:

- what’s open today (lifts status, etc.)
- school, ski/snowboard, accommodations
- marketing content (pages)
- even compare **rental prices for a family** (equipment included)

And yes: **voice interaction**, ChatGPT-style.

## What the data says (Vercel Analytics - Sep 27, 2024 → Jan 3, 2026)

![Vercel Analytics overview showing 1,153,491 visitors and 3,151,214 page views](/laax/analytics-overview.png)

Over that full period:

- **1,153,491 visitors**
- **3,151,214 page views**
- big seasonal peak: **173,247 visitors in Nov 2025**

### Mobile is the baseline (not “nice to have”)

![Vercel Analytics breakdown showing devices, top pages, referrers, and countries](/laax/analytics-breakdown.png)

Device split:

- **67% mobile**
- **31% desktop**
- **1% tablet**

So when I say “responsiveness mattered,” I mean: **this platform lives in pockets**.

### Where users spend time

Top pages by visitors:

- `/` - **374K**
- `/shop` - **178K**
- `/shop/tickets/details` - **176K**
- `/school` - **58K**

That’s the clearest signal that the site isn’t only marketing - **shopping and booking are core.**

---

## The KPI I’m most proud of: what users say after paying

On the confirmation page (post-purchase), we collected **479 ratings**:

- **Average score:** **7.9 / 10**
- **Breakdown:** 87 unsatisfactory · 129 good · 263 excellent  
  → that’s ~**55% “excellent”**

Some of my favorite comments (because they repeat the same theme: simplicity):

> “Kurz und einfach. Super Sache.” - 10/10 (2025-11-10)  
> “Schnelle und übersichtliche Bestellabwicklung.” - 10/10 (2025-11-24)  
> “Easy, selbsterklärend. Freue mich!” - 10/10 (2026-01-01)

If I summarize 400+ comments in one line:
**people loved a fast flow, clear steps, and an experience that feels effortless.**

---

## What I learned (the stuff you don’t see on the homepage)

### 1) Alignment > code

Cross-department platforms fail more from misalignment than from bugs.
You need shared incentives, clear ownership, and leadership support.

### 2) Content modeling is product design

A good schema prevents chaos.
A bad schema creates infinite edge cases.

### 3) Performance is a feature (especially on maps)

On an interactive map, small delays compound quickly - especially on mobile.

### 4) “Easy” is usually hard work

“Easy, selbsterklärend” (self-explanatory) is not an accident.
It’s hundreds of small UX decisions.

## Closing

This project is one of my proudest experiences because it combined:

- real stakeholder complexity
- real seasonality pressure
- real users
- and real measurable outcomes

And personally: going from remote building in Amsterdam to standing in that LAAX meeting room - with every department in front of us - was the moment I realized:

**this is what “shipping in the real world” actually means.**
